# WinterTweaks Refreshed UI â€“ Abandoned Client Project

**WinterTweaks** is a Windows optimization application. I was hired to redesign its user interface.

After fully redesigning the UI and sharing a live preview, the client refused to complete the agreed payment of 20$ more (total of 5 + 20$). They simply said:  
> *"I don't need your work now."*

Despite several discussions and a partial $5 payment, the rest of the deal was never honored. As a result, Iâ€™ve chosen to publicly open-source the UI I designed for this project. I might also write a blog post on this, soon.

## ðŸš« Lesson Learned

Going forward, I will no longer:
- Begin client work without full or milestone-based payment in advance.
- Share live previews of unreleased work without compensation.

## âœ… License & Usage

This UI code is open-sourced for others to benefit from.  
If you're building a similar Windows tweaks/optimization tool, you're welcome to use this repo as a reference or starting point for your design.

## ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack Used

- React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui
- Electron (planned integration)

---

## ðŸ’¬ Final Note

This project represents many late nights and sincere effort. While the original client backed out, I hope this work proves useful to someone who appreciates clean design and respects developer time.

Feel free to fork but please don't open any issues or PRs as I'm not looking to extend this.
Thanks for stopping by.
